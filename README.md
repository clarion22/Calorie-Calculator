# 🥗 Calorie Calculator

The **Calorie Calculator** is a web-based tool that helps you estimate the time required to burn calories based on **MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task)** values and your personal **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**. This tool is designed to provide personalized insights to support your fitness goals. 💪

## 🚀 How It Works

The calculator uses the formula:  
**🕒 Time (hours) = 🔥 Calories / (MET × 🛌 Resting Calories Per Hour)**  

- **🔥 Calories:** The number of calories you want to burn.  
- **🏃 MET:** The Metabolic Equivalent of Task value representing the intensity of the activity.  
- **🛌 Resting Calories Per Hour:** Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) divided by 24.  

### 📊 BMR Calculation
Your **BMR** is the number of calories your body burns at rest. It is calculated using the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**:  

- **👨‍🔬 For Males:**  
  `BMR = 10 × Weight (kg) + 6.25 × Height (cm) - 5 × Age (years) + 5`  

- **👩‍🔬 For Females:**  
  `BMR = 10 × Weight (kg) + 6.25 × Height (cm) - 5 × Age (years) - 161`  

### 🛌 Resting Calories Per Hour
Your resting calories burned per hour are calculated as:  
**🛌 Resting Calories Per Hour = BMR ÷ 24**
